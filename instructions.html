      Before the experiment begins we will have a quick check to make sure your audio works well enough for the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
You will listen to streams of words. The streams of words don't always
make a lot of sense. Some streams will make more sense than
others. Please try to listen to all of the words and look at the cross
in the centre of the screen at all times.</p>
  <p>
    At <b>the end</b> of each stream of words you will be asked whether you've heard a four-word phrase. You will not hear these exact phrases during the experiment but an example of a four-word phrase could be:
      <p>ask him this thing</p>
      <p>from my old car</p>
      <p>sit in that tree</p>
    If you think you heard a four word phrase please press 'y' at <b>the
    end</b> of the word stream and <b>only when prompted</b>. If you didn't hear
    any four word phrases please press 'n' at <b>the end</b> of the word
    stream and <b>only when prompted</b>.
  </p>
  <p>At the end of the experiment you will be asked some additional questions to assess how well you have been able to pay attention.
